## Notes

- I struggled with adding images to the cards, before finally learning that they should be added to the 'public' folder or imported if added in the 'src' folder. 
- I had a challenge with adding the background image in the header. Even though it was in the public folder, it was not being rendered and I had to use css to add the image instead of HTML (the address seemed correct and I also experimented with it a number of times but to no avail)
- During the initial stags, after deleting the react stater code, the page was not displaying any content. This was an issue with the render import statement and when I changed this to allow {render} to be imported from react-dom rather than react the code worked.
